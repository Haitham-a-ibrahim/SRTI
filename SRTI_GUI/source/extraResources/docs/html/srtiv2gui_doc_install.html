		<h2>How To Install / Download:</h2>
		<p>SRTI v2.00.00 and the corresponding v2 GUI are considered separate components. 
		Both are open-source, and a pre-compiled version is available for download.</p> 
		<p>No installation of the SRTI is required to open and run the SRTI. However,
		your computer system must have a version of the <b>Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</b> 
		installed to run the RTI Server. 
		Additionally, your system may also require installation of your language library 
		of choice, to support simulators written in different programming languages.</p>
		
		<br> 
		
		<h3>Downloading SRTI v2.00.00 (without GUI):</h3>
		<p>Go to the following Github URL: 
		<a href="https://github.com/ICoR-code/SRTI/tree/master/SRTI_Compiled/SRTI_v2_00_00" 
		target="_blank">https://github.com/ICoR-code/SRTI/tree/master/SRTI_Compiled/SRTI_v2_00_00</a></p>
		<p>SRTI v2.00.00 requires 3 main components: 1 instance of the <b>"RTI Server,"</b> 
		'n' instances of the <b>"RTI Wrapper"</b> (in Java, or another supported language), 
		and 'n' instances of simulators (provided by the user). The RTI Wrapper also makes
		use of the RTI Lib API to connect with the RTI Server: both the API and the Server 
		are stored in the same .jar file, but the user will need to copy different instances
		of the same file for each folder location.</p>
		<p>The file containing the RTI Server is called: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>SRTI_v2_22_02.jar</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The files for RTI Wrapper (Java, Matlab, NetLogo) are called:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>SRTI_JavaWrapper_v2_22_02.jar</li>
			<li>SRTI_Wrapper_v2_22_02.m</li>
			<li>[NetLogoWrapper_Download_Link.txt -> gives instructions to 
			download a Java .jar file that includes an internal copy of NetLogo]</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To run an instance of a SRTI v2.00.00 project, first launch the RTI Server. Then 
		launch each individual RTI Wrapper (to start their corresponding simulators), which
		will connect to the open instance of the RTI Server.</p>
		<p>To run the RTI Server, double-click on the .jar file. A simplified Java-Swing-based GUI
		will open to indicade the Server is active, and to indicate any messages it receives. 
		Alternatively, this program can be launched through the command line to observe additional
		log output. An optional "settings.txt" file can be placed in the same directory as the RTI Server
		to set certain properties (see Github for example).</p>
		<p>To run the RTI Wrapper, you may need to include a reference to the simulator file
		in your filepath or classpath. Therefore, you might need to launch this through a 
		command line, using a specific command. See HTML Documentation under 
		<b>"SRTI v2.00.00 - User Simulations."</b> Additional configuration files in the same
		folder location tell the RTI Wrapper what simulator it must launch, and how they function
		relative to other simulators in an open simulation system. See HTML Documentation under 
		<b>"SRTI v2.00.00 - RTI Configuration File."</b></p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>Downloading SRTI v2 GUI (with RTI Server included):</h3>
		<p>Go to the following Github URL: 
		<a href="https://github.com/ICoR-code/SRTI/tree/master/SRTI_GUI" target="_blank">
		https://github.com/ICoR-code/SRTI/tree/master/SRTI_GUI</a></p>
		<p>The v2 GUI is an optional component that allows the user to visually create and 
		generate the configuration files the RTI Wrapper(s) need to define what simulator 
		files they are running, and how they correspond to external simulators. The compiled
		v2 GUI includes a copy of the RTI Server, but this reference can be replaced by the 
		user in their v2 GUI project. RTI Wrapper files are not included and must be downloaded
		separately.</p>
		<p>There are 2 versions of the SRTI v2 GUI: a single packaged standalone executable, and an
		unpacked folder with an executable. You may use either of these, the only difference being
		the unpacked version opens more quickly (the packed version becomes unpacked in memory upon
		startup). For each version, double click on [TO DO] or [TO DO] to open the v2 GUI.</p>
		<p>We recommend you maintain a similar folder structure to the following to manage your project(s):</p>
		<ul>
			<li>"*/GUI/": Store the SRTI v2 GUI executable.</li>
			<li>"*/projects/": Store the v2 GUI project files saved from an open instance of the v2 GUI.</li>
			<li>"*/sims/": Store folders for each individual simulator from your or your collaborators. Each folder should include the simulator, the corresponding RTI Wrapper, and if necessary, a corresponding RTI Lib API.</li>
			<li>"*/server/": If you are not using the RTI Server included with the v2 GUI, include a copy of the .jar file in here.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>Downloading / Compiling SRTI v2.00.00 Source Code (optional):</h3>
		<p><i>This is only recommended if the pre-compiled executable files do not run 
		successfully on your machine, or if you need to modify the source code of the SRTI.</i></p>
		<ol>
		<li>Go to the following Github URL: 
			<a href="https://github.com/ICoR-code/SRTI/tree/master/SRTI_Source" target="_blank">
			https://github.com/ICoR-code/SRTI/tree/master/SRTI_Source</a></li>
			<ul>
				<li>The folder "/v1_v2_Java_Server_Client_Source/SRTI_v2_00_00/" contains code for the RTI Server and RTI Lib API.</li>
				<li>The folder "/v2_XXX_Sim_Wrapper_Source/" contains code for an RTI Wrapper in a given coding language.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Download the source code. Remember that there are 2 project files:</li>
			<ul>
				<li><b>RTI Server + RTI Lib API</b> in the same project / package: This is distinct
				from the SRTI v1.00.00 version.</li>
				<li><b>RTI Wrapper</b>: Separate project folders available for Java, Matlab, 
				NetLogo, and Python. Makes use of compiled version of RTI Server + RTI Lib API.
			</ul>
		<li>Install Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.</li>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Installing JDK:</b> see 
				<b><a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html" target="_blank">
				https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html</a></b>.</li>
				<li>The SRTI Java files were originally programmed in the <b>Eclipse Java IDE</b> (v.2018-12). 
				You may choose to install Eclipse 
				(<b><a href="https://www.eclipse.org/" target="_blank">https://www.eclipse.org/</a></b>) 
				and import the file structure as a new project,
				or to use an alternative method to edit / compile the original Java code.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>If required, download additional compilers to compile langauge-specific RTI Wrapper
		(example: Matlab, NetLogo, Python, etc.).</li>
		<li>When compiling, remember to include any required dependencies:</li>
			<ul>
				<li><b>RTI Server + RTI Lib API:</b> requires included .jar files: javax.json-1.0.4.jar.</li>
				<li><b>RTI Wrapper:</b> requires included .jar files: javax.json-1.0.4.jar, 
				SRTI_v2_22_02.jar (or other compiled version of RTI Server + RTI Lib API).</li>
				<li>The RTI Wrapper requires reference to a valid compatible simulator in the intended 
				programming language. More information about the design requirements for a simulator 
				compatible with SRTI v2.00.00 can be found in the HTML Documentation under 
				<b>"SRTI v2.00.00 - User Simulations."</b></li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Downloading / Compiling SRTI v2 GUI Source Code (optional):</h3>
		<p><i>This is only recommended if the pre-compiled executable files do not run 
		successfully on your machine, or if you need to modify the source code of the SRTI v2 GUI.</i></p>
		<p><i>This section exclusively explains the compilation of the v2 GUI, and not the core SRTI 
		components.</i></p>
		<p>The SRTI v2 GUI was programmed and compiled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery. 
		Compilation into a desktop app for Windows, Mac and Linux (and certain desktop-specific features) 
		was made possible through the Electron JS GUI framework. More information on Electron can be
		found at: <b><a href="https://www.electronjs.org/" target="_blank">https://www.electronjs.org/</a></b>.</p>
		<p>The SRTI v2 GUI requires multiple third-party developer dependencies, which the original 
		SRTI project avoided in order to ensure compatibility and ease-of-use for both users and developers.
		The v2 GUI is considered an optional component to use the SRTI: we encourage new groups to develop
		their own GUI solutions that visually represent and generate the files needed for the SRTI 
		(RTI Server and RTI Wrapper) to function.</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Go to the following Github URL: 
			<a href="https://github.com/ICoR-code/SRTI/tree/master/SRTI_GUI/source" target="_blank">
			https://github.com/ICoR-code/SRTI/tree/master/SRTI_GUI/source</a></li>
		<li>Download the source code. Windows OS is considered to be the "master" version to test with,
		but the source should also compile for Mac and Linux.</li>
		<li>Create a blank folder to store the project locally on your machine. It is recommended 
		you first install the required dependencies (either in this new folder location, or globally), 
		and then copy the original project files.</li>
		<li>Install NodeJS, NPM (if not included with NodeJS), 'tree-kill' module, Semantic UI JS library, 
		and Electron JS 6.1.7.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Electron 6.1.7 is recommended, because subsequent versions change how to access 
				folders on your local file system to match correct expected behavior, and at the time 
				of this writing, did not provide an alternative to allow our desired function.</li>
				<li><b>Installing NodeJS</b>: See 
				<b><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">https://nodejs.org/en/</a></b>.</li>
				<li><b>Installing NPM</b>: This should be included with the NodeJS install. See 
				<b><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm" target="_blank">https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm</a></b>
				for how to check that it was installed, or else see additional options to install for your 
				operating system (Linux might require an additional "apt install" command).</li>
				<li><b>Installing Electron 6.1.7</b>: Example command to install through command prompt:</li>
				<ul>
					<li><b><code>npm install -save-dev electron@6.1.7</code></b></li>
				</ul>
				<li><b>Install 'tree-kill' module</b> (NPM package that v2 GUI uses to be able to 
				start / stop simulator programs): Example command to install through command prompt:</li>
				<ul>
					<li><b><code>npm install tree-kill</code></b></li>
				</ul>
				<li><b>Install Semantic UI</b>: This should be included in existing v2 GUI project files.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>After installing dependencies at a blank folder location, new folders and files should be generated.
		Copy the source code project files for v2 GUI into this folder. Important files to copy include:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>All individual files at top of directory (index.html, main.js, etc.).</li>
				<li>"*/extraResources/" folder.</li>
				<li>"*/scripts/" folder.</li>
				<li>"*/semantic/" folder.</li>
				<li>"*/srti_modules/" folder.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>To run a test-build of the v2 GUI project, open a command prompt at the top of this project location,
		and run the following command. If successful, you will see a functional version of the v2 GUI window open.</li>
				<ul>
					<li><b><code>npm run dev</code></b></li>
				</ul>
		<li>To compile a standalone executable, we recommend using "Electron-Builder."</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Run the following command to install "Electron-Builder":</li>
					<ul>
						<li><b><code>npm install -g electron-builder --save-dev</b></code></li>
					</ul>
				<li>Run the following command to compile. If successful, you will have both a single packaged 
				executable file, and a directory of the unpackaged version.</li>
					<ul>
						<li><b><code>npm run build</code></b></li>
					</ul>
				<li>An alternative to "Electron-Builder" is "Electron-Packager." 
				This might require modifying "*/package.json" to use.</li>
			</ul>
