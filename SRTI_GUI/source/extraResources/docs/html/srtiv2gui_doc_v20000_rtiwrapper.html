		<h2>SRTI v2.00.00 - RTI Wrapper:</h2>
		<p>This section provides extra details on the functionality of the RTI Wrapper.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>Brief Overview:</h3>
		<p>The <b>RTI Wrapper</b> is a new, important component that differentiates
		SRTI v2.00.00 from v1.00.00. Originally, the user would have to add lines of 
		programming to their simulator's source code to call upon functions in the 
		RTI Lib API, to initiate and maintain a connection to the RTI Server, and
		to publish or receive messages from other parts of a simulation system.
		This makes a simulator dependent on the SRTI, making it less portable
		and requiring extra responsibility on the user. The RTI Wrapper now manages
		these responsibilities, both by calling the RTI Lib API functions at
		the correct times, and by copying and setting data saved in public variables
		in a connected simulator.</p>
		<p>The following image illustrates this difference, as well as which 
		component is accessing the other.</p>
		<img src="images/srtiv2gui_doc_v20000rtiwrapper_img_01.png" style="max-width:94%;margin:2%;" align="middle">
		<p>Normally, a computer program couldn't arbitrarily access functions or variables
		from an external program, if it isn't known until after compilation and before runtime.
		But the RTI Wrapper accomplishes this, allowing it to be distributed as a pre-compiled
		program, such that the user doesn't have to compile it. 
		This is made possible thanks to a programming paradigm called <b>"reflection."</b>
		A feature available in most modern lanauges, it allows a program to start an
		instance of an arbitrary program / object-oriented-class, and to query information
		from it, including names of publicly-accessible functions and variables. This 
		feature also allows accessing the data stored in these variables, or calling 
		an external function. 
		</p>
		<p>The general pattern of utilizing the RTI Lib API is fairly consistent
		(set simulator name, connect to open RTI Server instance, subscribe to relevant 
		messages, wait for next expected message, publish new message, etc.). Similarly,
		the moments of when a simulator's data variables or simulate functions need to
		be called are generally the same. With this in mind, the RTI Wrapper was written
		to execute these steps in an expected order, and should satisfy most requirements
		that would have been met by a user directly using the RTI Lib API.</p>
		<p>There are limitations to this. "Reflection" is not supported by all 
		programming languages, especially older ones (C++ is a major example), and
		the recommended alternative would be to write a custom Wrapper for a specific
		simulator, which can be a major task. Even with reflection, one program couldn't
		easily access any other program written in a different language, so our
		general guidance is that a RTI Wrapper must be written in the same language
		as the user's simulator (a handful of RTI Wrapper examples in different languages
		are provided). It is also impossible for the RTI Wrapper to automatically know
		what variables and functions in a simulator are of interest: to guide it,
		a user must still provide some information, which in the official case, is
		provided in an external ASCII-text JSON file as a large set of parameters.
		And despite a user's simulator not requiring direct reference to the SRTI,
		it has to be written in an object-oriented pattern, to make variables and functions
		accessible by an external program, and that functions must be written to accomplish
		one "timestep" of a simulation rather than its entirety: our internal experience shows 
		that this might type of design might be
		be unintuitive to some users (computer programming allows for an infinite number
		of design patterns), and might require significant modification to be
		compatible.</p>
		<p>Where possible, the RTI Wrapper is provided as a pre-compiled program.
		This assumes that the user's simulator is also pre-compiled.
		In some supported languages, like Matlab or Python, the idea of 'compiling' 
		the scripted language isn't possible, in which case a raw script in the same
		language is provided, to be run in the same way the original simulator would be
		(and allowing the user's simulator to not be pre-compiled to be accessed).</p>
		<p>The RTI Wrapper handles translating variables to string format when necessary
		to send to the RTI Server, and translating back again to expected raw format for
		the local language. Supported datatypes include <b>[strings, integer, double, boolean]</b>.
		Arrays and multi-dimensional arrays are also supported (translated into JSON-array
		format when added to an SRTI message), but different types in given languages are
		expected <b>[Java = array [], Matlab = matrix, NetLogo = List, Python = List]</b>. Non-primitive types 
		(example: a 'struct' or 'enum' type) are not supported natively by the RTI Wrapper,
		and would have to be translated into a simpler format within the simulator.</p>

		<br>

		<h3>Configuration Files:</h3>
		<p>An important part that allows the RTI Wrapper to function are the configuration files
		placed in the same folder location as the Wrapper application. This file provides information
		to the Wrapper regarding the simulator it corresponds to, what functions and variables
		inside that simulator to utilize, and how it corresponds to the rest of the active 
		simulation system, all without any modification or re-compilation required of the Wrapper.</p>
		<p>These configuration files are in JSON format, and can be read and modified in a 
		typical text editor on your operating system (Notepad, Notepad++, gedit, etc.). 
		Due to its complexity, one of the major purposes of the <b>SRTI v2 GUI</b> is to
		provide a graphic interface to help visualize and define the internal properties for
		the configuration file, and to generate them for use.</p>
		<p>More information about the configuration files can be reviewed in the HTML 
		Documentation under <b>"SRTI v2.00.00 - RTI Configuration File."</b></p>

		<br>

		<h3>How To Use (Launch) - Java Version:</h3>
		<p>The RTI Server is contained in an executable .jar file that can be opened by 
		double-clicking on it in your file system, like you would with most applications.
		However, if this was attempted with the RTI Wrapper, an error would be thrown. This is
		because the RTI Wrapper would not have access to the compiled-Java simulator it is
		meant to function with.</p>
		<p>Instead, the RTI Wrapper must be launched through a command line terminal, 
		specifying an additional property called "classpath" (cp), and specifying to launch
		the RTI Wrapper's "main" function as the initial starting point. Suppose a user has a
		pre-compiled Java simulator stored in "User_Simulator_01.jar": The command in Windows
		looks like this:</p>
		<ul>
		<code>java -cp "User_Simulator_01.jar;SRTI_JavaWrapper_v2_22_02.jar" main.Wrapper</code>
		</ul>
		<p>This command specifies a classpath (-cp) that includes both the original simulator class
		and the Wrapper class for Java, and requests to start the class "Wrapper" stored in package "main"
		inside "SRTI_JavaWrapper_v2_22_02.jar". If the original simulator has a package or program of the same
		name, this command might throw an error, claiming the Wrapper class cannot be found.
		</p>
		<p>For Mac and Linux, it looks slightly different:</p>
		<ul>
		<code>java -cp "User_Simulator_01.jar:SRTI_JavaWrapper_v2_22_02.jar" main.Wrapper</code>
		</ul>
		<p>Keep in mind that the RTI Wrapper for <b>Java</b> was tested and intended to run with
		a pre-compiled .jar version of a user-provided Java simulator. This is different from
		the other provided RTI Wrappers (Matlab, NetLogo, Python), which are scripting and 
		interpreted languages that don't typically have a concept of "pre-compiling" code
		for distribution. More information on the differences between languages can be reviewed
		in the HTML Documentation under <b>"SRTI v2.00.00 - User Simulations and Language 
		Differences."</b></p>
		
		<br>

		<h3>How To Use (Launch) - Other Languages:</h3>
		<p>For <b>Matlab</b>, the corresponding Wrapper is called "SRTI_Wrapper_v2_22_02.m". 
		It is not pre-compiled, and can be copied in the same location as a un-compiled 
		Matlab simulator to access it. Because the Wrapper isn't pre-compiled, it expects a copy of 
		SRTI_v2_22_02.jar (containing the RTI Lib API) to be in the same directory.
		To start it, open the Matlab Wrapper in Mathworks' Matlab program
		interface (this requires a licensed installtion of Matlab), and run it: it should
		be able to access the correct simulator script by reading configuration files saved 
		in the same location. </p>
		<p>Alternatively, the program can be run in a command line interface with a command
		similar to the following (further information can be found in Matlab's documentation):</p>
		<ul>
		<code>matlab -r "try, run('SRTI_Wrapper_v2_22_02.m');end;quit;"</code>
		</ul>
		<p>For <b>NetLogo</b> (an agent-model-inspred scripting language), 
		the language happens to have limited compatibility with Java.
		The NetLogo SRTI Wrapper was written in Java, pre-compiled with a full installation of
		NetLogo 6.1, allowing it to open a NetLogo project directly, even on computer systems without
		a NetLogo installation. Some differences between NetLogo versions, and restricted access to 
		some non-standard NetLogo plugins, might prevent the Wrapper from successfully running
		a NetLogo simulator.</p>
		<p>Since the NetLogo Wrapper was written in Java, a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 
		must be installed, and the Wrapper can be run in the same way as the Java version.
		The classpath is no longer necessary, but is written similarly here for consistency:</p>
		<ul>
		<code>java -cp "SRTI_NetLogoWrapper_v2_22_02.jar" main.Wrapper</code>
		</ul>
		<p>For <b>Python</b>, there are new issues. The language is not natively compatible with
		Java classes or .jar files, preventing it from natively accessing the Java RTI Lib API.
		With this in mind, there are 2 provided solutions to support Python: 1) A Python RTI Wrapper
		that uses the open-source library 'py4j' to connect to a custom Java RTI Lib API, and 2)
		A Python RTI Wrapper that uses a version of the RTI Lib API re-written in native Python,
		with most of the functionality of the original Java version. Option 2) is recommended, 
		but should it produce unexpected errors, option 1) is expected to function better, thanks 
		to its reliance on the more robust Java RTI Lib API.</p>
		<p>The 'py4j' prototype Wrapper consists of 2 projects, one in Java 
		(the RTI Lib API with a 'py4j' hook) and one in Python (the RTI Wrapper). These have 
		not been compiled into executable files. The user must download the source code and compile / run
		each project. They must first run the RTI Server (separately), then run the Java RTI Lib API
		(for the RTI Wrapper to have something to connect to), and then run the Python RTI Wrapper,
		in this order. The source code for these 2 components can be found at the following link:
		<a href="https://github.com/ICoR-code/SRTI/tree/master/SRTI_Source/v2_Python_py4j_Sim_Wrapper_Source">
		https://github.com/ICoR-code/SRTI/tree/master/SRTI_Source/v2_Python_py4j_Sim_Wrapper_Source</a>.</p>
		<p>The native Python RTI Wrapper is not compiled (Python scripts are generally compiled at runtime,
		and not compiled to be portable). It consists of the following scripts: SRTI_Python_Wrapper_v2_22_02.py 
		(the main script), RTILib.py, and RTISimConnectThread.py. These must be placed in the same directory,
		on a machine with an installation of Python. Like other RTI Wrapper examples, the user's simulator
		(written in Python) and it's relevant configuration files should also be in the same directory. 
		The Python RTI Wrapper can be launched by running SRTI_Python_Wrapper_v2_22_02.py, either 
		in the user's preferred Python IDE, or with a command prompt / terminal command like the following:</p>
		<ul>
		<code>python SRTI_Python_Wrapper_v2_22_02.py</code>
		</ul>
		
		<br>

		<h3>Underlying Design (programming):</h3>
		<p>In addition to the general expected order of events (connect to RTI Server, publish messages, etc.),
		the RTI Wrapper also allows subscribing to "initial" messages before executing a simulator's
		functions, updating what simulator properties to use when a stage changes,
		and to let the RTI Server to know when to proceed to a new timestep, 
		it waits for a message called "RTI_StartStep" and sends "RTI_FinishStep" when it has finished.
		Because of this complexity, getting familar with the source code design 
		is beneficial, but not required if a user relies on existing, provided RTI Wrappers.
		</p>
		<p>If a user needs to program a custom RTI Wrapper for their specific language or simulator,
		it is recommended to study the source code for the Java version of the RTI Wrapper 
		(considered to be the master version), or to study its similarities to RTI Wrappers
		in other languages. The source code can be accessed here: 
		<a href="https://github.com/ICoR-code/SRTI/tree/master/SRTI_Source/v2_Java_Sim_Wrapper_Source/source/SRTI_v2_00_00_Wrapper_Java" 
		target="_blank">https://github.com/ICoR-code/SRTI/tree/master/SRTI_Source/v2_Java_Sim_Wrapper_Source/source/SRTI_v2_00_00_Wrapper_Java
		</a>. <b>"Wrapper.java"</b> is the main class.</p>
		<p>A more detailed overview of the RTI Wrapper internal design can be
		read here: 
		<a href="https://github.com/ICoR-code/SRTI/blob/master/SRTI_Documentation/SRTI_v02_20_02_Documentation.pdf"
		target="_blank">https://github.com/ICoR-code/SRTI/blob/master/SRTI_Documentation/SRTI_v02_20_02_Documentation.pdf</a></p>
		<p>If a new language RTI Wrapper is unable to access the RTI Lib API
		in the pre-compiled Java .jar file, then the RTI Lib API may also need to be
		re-written in the native language of the new simulator.</p>
