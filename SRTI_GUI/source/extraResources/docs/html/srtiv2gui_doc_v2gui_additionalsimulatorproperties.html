		<h2>SRTI v2 GUI - Additional Simulator and Message Properties:</h2>
		<p>This section covers additional important properties you can modify
		for simulators, and messages in your project. Access to these can
		allow you to modify both previously set and new properties.</p> 

		<br> 
		
		<h3>How To Acces These Properties:</h3>
		<img src="images/srtiv2gui_doc_v2gui_additionalsimulatorproperties_img_01.png" style="max-width:94%;margin:2%;" align="middle">
		<p>On the Action Mode Bar, select "configure/edit" mode. In this mode,
		when you select any object, properties and buttons will appear in the
		Inpsector Panel.</p>

		<br>
		
		<h3>Simulator Properties:</h3>
		<p>If you click on a simulator in the Simulator Object List Panel,
		you'll see something like this:</p>
		<img src="images/srtiv2gui_doc_v2gui_additionalsimulatorproperties_img_02.png" style="max-width:94%;margin:2%;" align="middle">
		<p>"Change Properties" will let you modify the properties
		you defined when you first added the simulator,
		including name, RTI Wrapper folder location, 
		execute command, and listing public variables and functions.</p>
		<p>"Configure Remote SSH Details" will allow you to 
		utilize an experimental feature, to use an included Java 
		program to open an SSH connection to a remote server 
		storing the simulator. By default, this will assume your
		simulator is "Local" (no SSH connection required), but you
		can change this to "SSH Remote" and fill in the Host IP 
		and Port to connect to, username and password, and the
		directory location of the simulator relative to the default
		root location at login.</p>

		<br>

		<h3>Message Properties:</h3>
		<p>If you click on a simulator in the Message Object List Panel,
		you'll see something like this:</p>
		<img src="images/srtiv2gui_doc_v2gui_additionalsimulatorproperties_img_04.png" style="max-width:94%;margin:2%;" align="middle">
		<p>"Change Properties" will let you modify the properties
		you defined when you first added the message,
		including name, and variables.</p>

		<br>

		<h3>Simulator Object Properties:</h3>
		<p>If you click on a simulator in the Simulator Canvas,
		you'll see something like this:</p>
		<img src="images/srtiv2gui_doc_v2gui_additionalsimulatorproperties_img_05.png" style="max-width:94%;margin:2%;" align="middle">
		<p>The options here are not set by default, but some of them 
		are important to set before running your simulation system. Details 
		regarding the meaning of these properties can be reviewed in the 
		HTML documentation under "<b>SRTI v2.00.00 - RTI Configuration File</b>."</p>
		<img src="images/srtiv2gui_doc_v2gui_additionalsimulatorproperties_img_06.png" style="max-width:94%;margin:2%;" align="middle">
		<p>"Change Local Time" lets you change whether or not the 
		simulator should run at every step, or every 'n' steps, or
		every few steps based on the value of a variable within the 
		simulator itself.
		</p>
		<img src="images/srtiv2gui_doc_v2gui_additionalsimulatorproperties_img_07.png" style="max-width:94%;margin:2%;" align="middle">
		<p>"Set Initialize and Simulate Functions" lets you 
		pick one function within the simulator to be called 
		at the beginning of the simulation (Initialize) or 
		at each timestep (Simulate).</p>
		<img src="images/srtiv2gui_doc_v2gui_additionalsimulatorproperties_img_08.png" style="max-width:94%;margin:2%;" align="middle">
		<p>"Change Stage Transition Conditions" lets you define 
		conditions to be met to change from this stage to a different
		stage. These conditions rely on comparing a variable inside 
		the simulator (or a proprietary variable in the SRTI system)
		against a value or another variable. You can require that 
		multiple conditions are met together (first panel), or that
		one condition of the collection is met (second, final panel).
		You must click "Add to Conditions List" to finalize the 
		condition.</p>
		<p>"Change End System Conditions"
		is similar to this, but without the ability to set the 
		destination stage to transition to (instead, it will request 
		that each RTI Wrapper finish execution).</p>
		<br>
		
		<h3>Message Object Properties:</h3>
		<p>There are no "local" properties to change when clicking on a 
		message on the Message Cnavas.</p>

		<br>
		
		<h3>Publish / Subscribe Properties:</h3>
		<p>You can click on a red box underneath a simulator on the Simulator Canvas
		representing a publish or subscribe connection to modify it. It will allow
		you to modify properties you previously defined (no new properties).</p>

		<br>
		
		<h3>RTI Server Properties:</h3>
		<p>You can click on the RTI Server object in the Message Canvas to access
		its properties. More details on this can be found in the HTML documentation
		under "<b>SRTI v2 GUI - RTI Server Properties</b>."</p>
