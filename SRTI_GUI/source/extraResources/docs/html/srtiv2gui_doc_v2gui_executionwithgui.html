		<h2>SRTI v2 GUI - Execution (with GUI):</h2>
		<p>This section covers details how to run a simulation system from within the SRTI v2 GUI.</p> 

		<br> 
		
		<h3>How To Run:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>First, click on "<b>File -> Export Execute Files</b>" in the Menu Bar.</li>
			<li>Click the <b>POWER</b> button in the Execute Bar, and wait a few seconds.
			You should see an instance of the RTI Server (with the Java-based Server GUI)
			open, and it should indicate that all expected simulators have connected 
			(this includes simulators that occur in any stage, not necesasrily just 
			stage 0). After a few seconds, the PLAY and STOP buttons should become 
			enabled. If launching a simulator in a large program (example: Matlab),
			wait until everything has launched, not just for when the PLAY button
			becomes available.</li>
				<ul>If the RTI Server or simulators have not launched or connected as expected,
				some further debugging may be required outside the SRTI v2 GUI.</ul>
			<li>Click the <b>PLAY</b> button. It should tell the RTI Server to start the 
			system, and the simulators will begin to run. Inside the SRTI v2 GUI,
			you should see simulators on the Simulator Canvas begin to change color,
			cycling from red to blue. The Inspector Panel should indicate the current 
			timestep of the simulation system, and a Feed of the most recent messages
			for you to analyze (each can be expanded to show their contents).</li>
				<ul>If a simulator changes red and stays red, that means the system 
				has halted, waiting for that simulator to "finish" the current step.</ul>

			<li>At any time, you can click the <b>PAUSE</b> button to temporarily pause 
			the active system. You can resume by clicking PLAY again.</li>
			<li>When you choose, you can click the <b>STOP</b> button to end execution and 
			close the RTI Server and all active simulators. If an "End Condition" is satisfied,
			it will cause this event automatically.</li>
				<ul>When closing these processes, it is normal for error and warning prompts to occur.
				Generally, these can be ignored.</ul>
		</ol>

		<h3>When To Use This Feature:</h3>
		<p>Being able to launch and control your SRTI simulation system from one location 
		is one of the major benefits of the SRTI v2 GUI. For most simulation systems
		using SRTI v2.00.00, we recommend giving this a try.</p>
		<p>However, if any errors occur, it can be difficult to debug the root cause 
		from the SRTI v2 GUI. If this becomes a problem, we recommended running your 
		system without the SRTI v2 GUI first, and to use the GUI for subsequent 
		runs when it is confirmed to work. See HTML Documentation for 
		<b>"SRTI v2.00.00 - Execution (without GUI)"</b> for more information.</p>
