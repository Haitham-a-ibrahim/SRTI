		<h2>SRTI v2.00.00 - Introduction:</h2>
		<h3>What is the SRTI?</h3>
		<p>SRTI stands for <b>"Simple Run-Time Infrastructure,"</b> where the term RTI comes from existing
		software solutions and standards of a similar nature. The SRTI is a data-sharing middleware 
		software tool, allowing simulators and programs to transfer data between each other, independent
		of programming language.</p> 
		<p>At the time of this writing, there are 2 versions of the SRTI: <b>v1.00.00</b> and <b>v2.00.00</b>. 
		v1.00.00 is the core-version, and is an API that can enable programs to send and receive messages, using
		a virtual server program as the central connecting hub. v2.00.00 builds off v1.00.00, introducing
		additional simulation-specific features (like time synchronization and order-of-execution) and
		further abstraction from the user's original simulator programming, allowing integration without adding
		lines of code to the simulator source code.</p>
		<p>Experienced programmers who want the most control, and have permissions to modify their simulators
		as required, may prefer to use SRTI v1.00.00. Users who want parts of their simulation development 
		automated by the SRTI, want to take advantage of the improved GUI, or have simulators that cannot be 
		modified to utilize the RTI Lib API directly, may prefer to use SRTI v2.00.00.</p>

		<h3>Core Components:</h3>
		<p>The SRTI system is made up of 3 core components: the <b>RTI Server</b>, <b>RTI Lib API</b>, and the 
		<b>user's provided simulator(s)</b>. v2.00.00 introduces a new component called the <b>RTI Wrapper</b>,
		which utilizes the RTI Lib API directly for the simulator, effectively taking its place in the eyes of
		the user. Additionally, the v2.00.00 version of the RTI Server is modified to include additional
		management logic, and may be referred in documentation or images as <b>RTI Server + Manager</b>.</p> 
		<p>The SRTI supports network communication (if using this, it is highly recommended that the RTI Server
		is running on a server with a static ip address), but localhost execution for all programs is recommended.
		If running on a network, the RTI Server can run on a separate machine, and each simulator must have 
		the RTI Lib API (or RTI Wrapper) in the same local folder location. TCP sockets are used for 
		communication.</p>
		<p>The RTI Wrapper also requires .json text files in the same folder location in order to run. The format
		of these files and their properties can be reviewed in the HTML Documentation under
		<b>"SRTI v2.00.00 - RTI Configuration File."</b></p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>Publish / Subscribe System:</h3>
		<p>The SRTI uses a <b>"publish / subscribe"</b> model to share data. Rather than requesting data or 
		requesting that a specific function is called, each simulator can subscribe to a message that contains
		data. Each message has a name as an identifier, and must be generated by the simulator-side (RTI Wrapper)
		to contain expected variables. Any simulator can publish any message. A simulator must "subscribe" to
		a message by name to receive any copies of it, and receives the message regardless of the source.</p>
		<p>To publish a message, a simulator's variables are used with the RTI Lib API to generate a message,
		and the RTI Lib API provides an interface to send it to the RTI Server. The RTI Server maintains a list 
		of simulators who are subscribed to that message, and upon receipt, immediately sends a copy to allowing
		subscribers. The RTI Lib API maintains a buffer (cache) of received messages, until the simulator 
		(RTI Wrapper) gets the most recent message for use.</p>
		<p>This choice to subscribe to messages rather than directly to other simulators is a conscious design
		choice, to further abstract simulator independence, allowing a simulator to be removed, added or replaced
		to a simulation system more easily.</p>
		<p>Messages are translated into JSON format as the independent standard. Among the values are "name" and
		"content," allowing simulators to subscribe by the name, and able to fit any content in any string-supported
		format in the content property. Unlike similar solutions, this supports virtually any data format without
		a strict specification to follow, putting the responsibility for data specification up to users to design
		and communicate to other users.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>Supported Languages:</h3>
		<p>SRTI v2.00.00 uses an RTI Server that is written in Java, which is independent from supported simulator 
		languages. Versions of the RTI Wrapper are available for simulators in Java, Matlab, NetLogo and Python.</p>
		<p>As an open-source project, we encourage external support for RTI Wrappers to allow simulators of 
		additional languages. Generally, a pre-compiled RTI Wrapper must be written in a language that supports 
		"reflection," a function of modern languages to query and access public functions and variables. As an
		example, C++ does not support this. Ad-hoc custom code to carry out the function of the RTI Wrapper 
		and / or RTI Lib API for a specific simulator can still be written to allow a simulator to be compatible
		with an existing SRTI system.</p>

		<h3>SRTI Design Goal:</h3>
		<p>The primary goal of the SRTI was to create a free, open-source software that is easy to start with,
		easy to use, and easy to modify if necessary. SRTI v1.00.00 fullfills these goals, and v2.00.00 improves
		on ease-of-use at the expense of more complex internal design. The SRTI supports many langauges (and has 
		room to support more from other users), and can be downloaded for use without the need to compile it from
		scratch on your local machine.</p> 
		<p>This is a major contrast against similar
		software solutions, which focus on speed at the expense of usability and cross-platform, cross-language
		support. However, the SRTI is significantly slower at runtime, partly due to its use of network-socket 
		communication, and mostly due to its use of JSON message formatting. Therefore, we do not recommend using 
		SRTI for large-scale high-performance computing, or for time-sensitive simulation systems. No such 
		software solution would be as fast as direct access between simulators written in a single file of the 
		same programming language, and we believe it is worth the effort to rewrite your simulators in a fast 
		language (example: C++) in a single program, if speed is your most critical factor. Alternatively, a 
		favorable arguement is that the SRTI represents a step towards a newvision of interdisciplinary computer simulation.</p>
		<p>As quoted from the ICoR research group's website: <i>"We aim to have a transformative impact on the 
		broad fields of disaster science and engineering. By using computational modeling as a common language to 
		link disparate disciplines, our objective is to develop a new computational framework that will open the 
		door for researchers to collaborate in new ways. The ability to seamlessly interface with other models 
		with minimal effort will foster entirely new collaborations between researchers who do not traditionally 
		work together, enabling as-of-yet unimagined studies within and contributions to the multi-hazards 
		engineering and disaster science fields."</i></p>
