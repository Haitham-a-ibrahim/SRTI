		<h2>SRTI v2 GUI - Adding Message:</h2>
		<p>This section outlines the steps to add a message definition to 
		a project in the SRTI v2 GUI.</p> 

		<br> 
		
		<h3>Steps:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>In "Select" mode, click on the "+ New" button at the top of the Object List Panel.</li>
			<img src="images/srtiv2gui_doc_v2gui_addingsimulator_img_01.png" style="max-width:94%;margin:2%;" align="middle">
			<li>Select "Message" as the new object you want to add, and click "Next."</li>
			<ul>
				Alternatively, you can select "Import...," which will ask you to select a .mesdef file, which is 
				automatically generated when you save other projects in the SRTI v2 GUI. If selecting this option,
				the following steps will become unecessary.
			</ul>

			<li>Fill in "Message Name" (name that the RTI Server and simulators will recognize it by),
			and add any variables the message will contain (the variable names can be arbitrary,
			but the datatypes should match corresponding types that will be copied to and from
			simulators (the data will not be cast to a different type by the SRTI).</li>
			<img src="images/srtiv2gui_doc_v2gui_addingmessage_img_03.png" style="max-width:94%;margin:2%;" align="middle">
			<li>When finished, you'll see the message added to the Object List Panel in the project.</li>
			<ul>
				If you want a second chance to edit the message definition you added, you
				can click on the entry in the Message List Panel in "Configure/Edit" mode.
			</ul>
			<img src="images/srtiv2gui_doc_v2gui_addingmessage_img_04.png" style="max-width:94%;margin:2%;" align="middle">
			<li>Click on the simulator entry in the Simulator List Panel, and it will be 
			added to the Message Canvas.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>The order of the message in the canvas is irrelevant. Also, the Message Canvas
				remains consistent in different stages: the RTI Server always listens to and 
				receives messages regardless of stage, so this representation is more appropriate.
				After adding it to the canvas, you will be unable to add the same message to the 
				canvas a second time (you cannot have two messages of the same name: that would
				confuse the RTI Server as to what each simulator is subscribed to!).</li>
			</ul>
