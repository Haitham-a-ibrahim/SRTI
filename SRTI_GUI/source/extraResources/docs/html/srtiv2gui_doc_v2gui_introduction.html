		<h3>Brief Overview:</h3>
		<p>The <b>SRTI v2 GUI</b> (Graphic User Interface) is an optional but 
		recommended component of SRTI v2.00.00. Built in JavaScript and CSS 
		as a desktop application using Electron JS, it's a much more useful
		and modern-looking GUI than the Java-based one used directly with 
		the RTI Server.</p>
		<p>There are 3 main purposes to the SRTI v2 GUI:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>To assist in <b>creating and exporting the configuration files 
			the RTI Wrapper(s) rely on</b>, in a visual, more intuitive manner.</li>
			<li>To act as a central location to <b>run / launch a simulation
			system</b>, using a panel to "Play / Pause / Stop" the system with
			a single click, rather than maintaining many separate
			simulators by hand.</li>
			<li><b>Saving work</b> made in the v2 GUI as projects, to more easily
			share simulation systems with other users.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Keep in mind that using the SRTI v2 GUI does not allow a user to
		avoid understanding the underlying details to how SRTI v2.00.00 functions.
		It is highly recommended that a user read through the documentation 
		for SRTI v2.00.00 before proceeding to try out the SRTI v2 GUI.</p>
