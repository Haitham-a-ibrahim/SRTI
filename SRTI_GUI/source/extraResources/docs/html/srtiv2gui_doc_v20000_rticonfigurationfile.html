		<h2>SRTI v2.00.00 - RTI Configuration File:</h2>
		<p>This section provides details on the format of the Configuration files that
		allow the RTI Wrapper (part of SRTI v2.00.00) to function.</p> 

		<br> 
		
		<h3>Brief Overview</h3>
		<p>The RTI Wrapper is a new component introduced in SRTI v2.00.00,
		and it provides a way for simulators to be added to an SRTI simulation 
		system without any modification of the simulator's source code, without
		any modification of the RTI Wrapper either. However,
		the RTI Wrapper doesn't magically understand a simulator's purpose
		or functionality: it relies on an external <b>configuration files</b>, written
		is ASCII-string format (JSON), to outline the simulator it is
		meant to reference, and how it relates to a larger simulation system.</p>
		<p>There are 3 configuration files expected to be in the same 
		file directory as the RTI Wrapper:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Settings.json</li>
			<li>XXX_global.json</li>
			<li>XXX_config.json</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>Settings.json</b> is a JSON file containing two variables: "global" and "configuration."
		Settings.json is a case-sensitive-named file that the RTI Wrapper will always search for.
		The two variables it contains are the names of the external files it needs to use:
		by storing file names in this way, the other two files can be given any name, 
		including custom names to better differentiate them from other simulator configuration 
		files.</p>
		<p><b>XXX_global.json</b> was intended to store information relevant for the entire simulation
		system and not just a single simulator. This was originally planned to be in use, 
		but ultimately was decided to be unecessary: this file is depricated and not in use.
		Furthermore, we discovered the word "global" is a reserved word in Python, preventing
		the current usage of it for a Python RTI Wrapper anyway! Regardless, it is kept 
		to prevent any errors in old code that attempts to search and read it, but the contents
		of the file are irrelevant.</p>
		<p><b>XXX_config.json</b> is the main file that contains the parameters that define
		a simulator relative to a simulation system in the SRTI. Its contents are listed in
		the below section called <b>"Table of Configuration Properties,"</b> but an example file
		might look something like this:</p>
