		<h2>SRTI v2 GUI - Different Stages:</h2>
		<p>This section covers the purpose of different stages in an SRTI v2 GUI project.</p> 

		<br> 
		
		<h3>Brief Overview:</h3>
		<p>There are many different types of simulation design. It's possible a user would
		want to design a simulation system that consists of multiple states or stages,
		where the events being simulated change during execution. One example might be 
		a scenario regarding natural disaster and recovery: one might want to first 
		simulate the natural disaster over several hours, and then the recovery 
		process that occurs over several days, all within one system.</p>
		<p>SRTI v2.00.00 and the SRTI v2 GUI are capable of supporting this type
		of design. Every simulator execution (including properties for what function
		to call to initialize or simulate, and publishing and susbscribing to messages)
		is given a stage number, and these definitions can be given a new stage
		number to indicate they are to execute at a different time. By default,
		all simulation systems begin by executing Stage 0, but a "stage condition"
		can define a condition that must be verified to transition to a new 
		specified stage. These transitions can occur in any order (you don't need
		to restrict yourself to 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> ...). Each stage can have it's own
		initialize logic for messages and functions.</p>

		<h3>Creating New Stages in the v2 GUI:</h3>
		<p>The "+" button on the Stage Bar allows you to add a new stage. By default, 
		you start with one stage, "Stage 0." After clicking "+" once, you should see
		two buttons, "0" and "1." You can repeat this for as many stages as you need.</p>
		<p>Click on a number to change to a new stage. The Simulator Canvas will update
		accordingly to display the current stage.</p>
		<p><i>At this time, the SRTI v2 GUI does not allow you to delete stages. 
		You can clear objects from a stage and remove any "stage conditions" that 
		would lead to them. Alternatively, it is possible to modify the .project file
		in a text editor that represents the SRTI v2 GUI and reopen it.</i></p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>Creating Stage Conditions:</h3>
		<p>Each simulator has the ability to save a "stage condition" property,
		with the option to check the value of a variable from an active simulator
		to qualify whether or not the stage should transition. You cannot define
		a single condition that checks multiple simulators at once. More details
		on this can be found in the HTML Documentation under 
		"<b>SRTI v2 GUI - Additional Simulator and Message Properties</b>."</p>
