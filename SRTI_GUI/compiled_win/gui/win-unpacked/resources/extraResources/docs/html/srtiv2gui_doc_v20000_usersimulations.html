		<h2>SRTI v2.00.00 - User Simulations and Language Differences:</h2>
		<p>This section briefly discusses notable differences for users using simulators 
		in one of the supported languages. As open-source software, users have the 
		capability of adapting further languages to be compatible with an SRTI system;
		some of the information described here might be of interest as limited guidance
		for what to expect.
		</p> 
		<p>Some general rules for all simulators in any language: 
		<ol>
			<li>The variables and functions that 
		are being written to or copied by the SRTI must be publicly accessable.
			</li>
			<li>The variables must be of simple types (int, boolean, string, arrays, etc.), and not of
			custom types (structs, classes, etc.).
			</li>
			<li>The functions should return no value (void) and should have no input parameters.</li>
		</ol></p>

		<h3>User Simulations in Java:</h3>
		<p>The Java version of the RTI Wrapper is written in Java and is pre-compiled 
		as a .jar file. Likewise, it is able to access an external Java simulator, if 
		it is also compiled into a .jar file. An installation of a Java Runtime Environment
		(JRE) is required to run this.</p>
		<p>To run the Java Wrapper, keep a copy of the Java Wrapper in the same
		file directory as your Java simulator. In a command prompt / terminal, run 
		the following command: </p>
		<code>java -cp "User_Simulator_01.jar;SRTI_JavaWrapper_v2_22_02.jar" main.Wrapper</code>
		<p>(for Mac and Linux, the command might be the following):</p>
		<code>java -cp "User_Simulator_01.jar:SRTI_JavaWrapper_v2_22_02.jar" main.Wrapper</code>
		<p>Notice that the simulator .jar file is specified, in order for an instance 
		of the Java Wrapper to have access to it.</p>
		<p>Below is a simple example of a Java simulator and configuration file:</p>
		<code style="display: block; white-space: pre-wrap;">
package groceries;

public class Groceries_A {

	public int totalApples = 4;
	public int wantApples = 0;

	public static void main(String [] args){
		// below is some sample code for if the user wanted to run this without the SRTI
		Groceries_A thisClass = new Groceries_A();
		for (int step = 0; step < 100; step++){
			if (step % 1 == 0){
				thisClass.UpdateNextStep();
			}
		}
	}

	public void Initialize(){
		totalApples = 4;
		wantApples = 0;
	}
	
	public void UpdateNextStep(){
		if (totalApples <= 1){
			wantApples = 5;
		} else {
			wantApples = 0;
		}
		totalApples--;
	}
}

		<h3>Differences for Matlab:</h3>
		<p>While compilation and distribution of stand-alone Matlab simulators is possible,
		most users will be used to running the code as a .m script directly in the Matlab
		editor. We also found it best to simply provided a raw .m Wrapper script, written in
		Matlab code, to run in the Matlab editor, and to access a non-compiled simulator script.
		These are key differences to the Java version of the RTI Wrapper, and requires the 
		user to have an installed license of Matlab on their computer.</p>
		<p>The RTI Wrapper .m file, and the user's simulator .m file, must be in the same 
		file directory. Also, the RTI Wrapper relies on the RTI Lib API (Java), which is 
		stored in the same executable .jar file as the RTI Server; a copy of this should also
		be in that file directory (the compiled Java RTI Wrapper included an internal copy 
		of the RTI Lib API).</p>
		<p>To run the Matlab Wrapper, keep a copy of the Matlab Wrapper in the same
		file directory as your Matlab simulator. In a command prompt / terminal, run 
		the following command: </p>
		<code>matlab -r "try, run('SRTI_Wrapper_v2_22_02.m');end;quit;"</code>
		<p>Alternative commands might be used to disable the Matlab GUI interface, or to 
		use other features of your Matlab installation.</p>
		<p>Below is a simple example of a Matlab simulator and configuration file
		(notice the object-oriented design pattern for the Matlab simulator as a class):</p>
		<code style="display: block; white-space: pre-wrap;">
classdef A < handle
	properties
		totalApples = 4
		wantApples = 0
	end
	
	methods
		function obj = A()
		
		end

		function Initialize(obj)
			obj.totalApples = 4;
			obj.wantApples = 0;
		end
		
		function UpdateNextStep(obj)
			if (obj.totalApples <= 1)
				obj.wantApples = 5;
			else
				obj.wantApples = 0;
			end
			obj.totalApples = obj.totalApples - 1;
		end
	end
end

		<h3>Differences for NetLogo:</h3>
		<p>NetLogo is a free scripting language designed for agent-based modeling and 
		visual simulations. Like Matlab, it does not typically use the concept of 
		compiling a simulator for others to use: it relies on an installation of NetLogo 
		on your local machine. But thanks to its compatibility with Java and its 
		licensing rules, we were able to compile a RTI Wrapper written in Java (.jar)
		with an included NetLogo installation (v 6.1). A user can launch 
		and run an uncompiled NetLogo script with this pre-compiled NetLogo Wrapper, 
		which will launch a version of NetLogo on your machine, without installation.</p>
		<p>A user might prefer to install a specific copy of NetLogo on their local 
		machine and utilize that, but the NetLogo RTI Wrapper cannot make use of this.
		Also, some additional plugins made for NetLogo might not function as expected,
		causing errors if your simulator utilizes specialized features.</p>
		<p>To run the NetLogo Wrapper, keep a copy of the NetLogo Wrapper in the same
		file directory as your NetLogo simulator. In a command prompt / terminal, run 
		the following command: </p>
		<code>java -cp "SRTI_NetLogoWrapper_v2_22_02.jar" main.Wrapper</code>
		<p>Notice that this command is similar to the Java command, but does not require 
		that you specify the simulator as part of the classpath.</p>
		<p>Below is a simple example of a configuration file and NetLogo simulator:</p>
		<code style="display: block; white-space: pre-wrap;">
globals [totalBlueberries wantBlueberries]

to Initialize
	clear-all
	set totalBlueberries 4
	set wantBlueberries 0
end

to UpdateNextStep
	ifelse totalBlueberries <= 1 [set wantBlueberries 5] [set wantBlueberries 0]
	set totalBlueberries totalBlueberries - 1
end

		<h3>Differences for Python:</h3>
		<p>Python has grown to be a popular scripting language, both in Computer Science and
		in external disciplines. Similar to the Matlab version of the RTI Wrapper, it was 
		meant to be run with a local installation of Python (a portable executable version 
		of a Python script is not typical). A greater issue is that Python does not support 
		native communication with Java libraries like Matlab or NetLogo do; either a third-party
		library must be used to enable this, or the RTI Lib API (which the RTI Wrapper relies on) 
		must be rewritten in the native language of the RTI Wrapper and simulator. Both solutions
		are provided, both to allow use with Python, and to serve as an example for open-source 
		developers to extend functionality for other languages.</p>
		<p>There are 2 provided solutions to support Python: 1) A Python RTI Wrapper
		that uses the open-source library 'py4j' to connect to a custom Java RTI Lib API, and 2)
		A Python RTI Wrapper that uses a version of the RTI Lib API re-written in native Python,
		with most of the functionality of the original Java version. Option 2) is recommended, 
		but should it produce unexpected errors, option 1) is expected to function better, thanks 
		to its reliance on the more robust Java RTI Lib API.</p>
		<p>The 'py4j' prototype Wrapper consists of 2 projects, one in Java 
		(the RTI Lib API with a 'py4j' hook) and one in Python (the RTI Wrapper). These have 
		not been compiled into executable files. The user must download the source code and compile / run
		each project. They must first run the RTI Server (separately), then run the Java RTI Lib API
		(for the RTI Wrapper to have something to connect to), and then run the Python RTI Wrapper,
		in this order. The source code for these 2 components can be found at the following link:
		<a href="https://github.com/ICoR-code/SRTI/tree/master/SRTI_Source/v2_Python_py4j_Sim_Wrapper_Source">
		https://github.com/ICoR-code/SRTI/tree/master/SRTI_Source/v2_Python_py4j_Sim_Wrapper_Source</a>.</p>
		<p>The native Python RTI Wrapper is not compiled (Python scripts are generally compiled at runtime,
		and not compiled to be portable). It consists of the following scripts: SRTI_Python_Wrapper_v2_22_02.py 
		(the main script), RTILib.py, and RTISimConnectThread.py. These must be placed in the same directory,
		on a machine with an installation of Python. Like other RTI Wrapper examples, the user's simulator
		(written in Python) and it's relevant configuration files should also be in the same directory. 
		The Python RTI Wrapper can be launched by running SRTI_Python_Wrapper_v2_22_02.py, either 
		in the user's preferred Python IDE, or with a command prompt / terminal command like the following:</p>
		<ul>
		<code>python SRTI_Python_Wrapper_v2_22_02.py</code>
		</ul>
		<p>Below is an example of a configuration file and Python simulator, based on the example from Java and Matlab.</p>
