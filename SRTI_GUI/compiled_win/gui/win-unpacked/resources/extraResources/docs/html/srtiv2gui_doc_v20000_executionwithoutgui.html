		<h2>SRTI v2.00.00 - Execution (without GUI):</h2>
		<p>This is a reminder of the steps to take to start an SRTI v2.00.00 system.
		Installing the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is the minimum requirement 
		to run the SRTI and its components.
		Further details about language-dependent commands can be reviewed in the 
		HTML documentation under <b>"SRTI v2.00.00 - RTI Wrapper"</b> and 
		<b>"SRTI v2.00.00 - User Simulations and Language Differences."</b></p> 

		<br> 
		
		<h3>Ordered Steps to Execute:</h3>
		<p>You can generally follow these steps to manually launch an SRTI v2.00.00 system.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Start the RTI Server.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Download and double-click on SRTI_v2_22_02.jar. A small window should appear 
				listing the hostname and portnumber.</li>
				<li>To set certain configuration details for the RTI Server, download "settings.txt" 
				and place in the same file directory.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Launch each individual simulator.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>If you haven't already done so, edit and prepare the appropriate 
				configuration files for the RTI Wrapper. This includes ensuring the
				port number to connect to the RTI Server is correct.</li>
				<li>Download and place the appropriate-language RTI Wrapper in the 
				same directory as your simulator file(s).</li>
				<li>Run the RTI Wrapper. Depending on the Wrapper you use, you may
				need to launch it through a command prompt / terminal.</li>
				<li>You should see each simulator listed in the Server GUI 
				when they each connect. If not, check for any errors from either
				the RTI Wrapper or RTI Server. Generally, it is recommended to 
				restart the RTI Server if something fails.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>When all simulators have been connected, click on the 
			"Send Start Request To All" button on the Server GUI.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>You should see the Server GUI updating with new messages.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>If you wish to pause / resume the simulation system temporarily,
			click on the "Send Pause Request To Server" button.</li>
			<li>To end the simulation system, close the Server GUI.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Each connected simulator should quit automatically, or 
				throw an error and remain open, depending on the language.
				Check and close each simulator manually if necessary to avoid
				ghost processes.</li>
			</ul>
		</ol>
		<p>Running each simulator manually can be tedious for large simulation systems 
		(as an example, if you have 10 simulators, you could need to have 10 command line / terminal
		windows active). The SRTI v2 GUI helps manage and automate this process, but 
		relies on these core instructions, which can be replicated on a variety of systems,
		including remote or cluster servers.</p>
