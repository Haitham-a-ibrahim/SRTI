		<h2>SRTI v2 GUI - Saving Project:</h2>
		<p>This section covers details how the SRTI v2 GUI saves its project files.</p> 

		<br> 
		
		<h3>How To Save:</h3>
		<img src="images/srtiv2gui_doc_v2gui_savingproject_img_01.png" style="max-width:94%;margin:2%;" align="middle">
		<p>To save a project, go to "File -> Save" or "File -> Save As" 
		in the Menu Bar, and follow prompts to name your project if necessary,
		and to choose a folder location. If successful, a notication will 
		appear indicating the file has been saved. After saving, you can 
		reopen the project through "File -> Open."</p>

		<br>
		
		<h3>What Do The Save Files Look Like?:</h3>
		<p>There are 3 types of files that get output when saving a project:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>1 ".project" file</li>
			<li>'n' ".simdef" files</li>
			<li>'n' ".mesdef" files</li>
		</ul>
		<p>All of these files are saved in ASCII-string JSON format, and 
		can be viewed in any text editor.</p>
		<p>The <b>.project</b> file is the main file, and it represents 
		all information about your project. The additional files are not required
		to reopen or transfer a project.</p>
		<p>The <b>.simdef</b> files represent each simulator definition you 
		added to your project. The data in this file is a portion of the 
		information already stored in the .project file. The reason these 
		are generated is to allow you to easily transfer simulator definitions 
		for use in other projects or for other users (you can add a new 
		simulator to a project using the "Import" option and selecting 
		a .simdef file).</p>
		<p>The <b>.mesdef</b> files serve the same purpose as the .simdef 
		files, but represent each definition of a mesasge in the project 
		rather than simulators.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>Exporting Files For Execution:</h3>
		<p>Under "File" in the Menu Bar, there is also an option called "<b>Export Execute Files</b>."</p>
		<p>When you make and save a project using the SRTI v2 GUI, you've only made a visual
		representation. When you click "Export Execute Files," you generate and output 
		the actual files required for a simulator system to run. This includes the 
		configuration files an RTI Wrapper relies on, and the "settings.txt" file for 
		the RTI Server. Each file is generated in the same folder location as 
		the RTI Wrapper and RTI Server in the project.</p>
		<p>Before trying to run a project, remember to both save your project and 
		to export excute files for it to behave as expected.</p>
