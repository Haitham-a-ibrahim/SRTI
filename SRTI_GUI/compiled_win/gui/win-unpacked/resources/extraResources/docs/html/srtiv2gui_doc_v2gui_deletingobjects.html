		<h2>SRTI v2 GUI - Deleting Obejcts:</h2>
		<p>This section outlines what you can delete in a SRTI v2 GUI project,
		and how to do it.</p> 

		<br> 
		
		<h3>What You Can Delete:</h3>
		<p>You can delete several types of objects that are visually represented 
		in a project open in the SRTI v2 GUI. These include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Simulators (in Simulator Object List Panel)</li>
			<li>Messages (in Message Object List Panel)</li>
			<li>Simulator Objects (in Simulator Canvas)</li>
			<li>Message Objects (in Message Canvas)</li>
			<li>Publish Connections (in Simulator Canvas)</li>
			<li>Subscribe Connections (in Simulator Canvas)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you delete something accidently, you can use the "Undo" 
		function (see Menu Bar -> Edit -> Undo) to bring it back.</p>
		<p>Keep in mind that if you delete an object that is referenced
		by other parts of the project, those too will be deleted.
		For example, if you delete a Simulator from the Simulator Object
		List Panel, any instances of that simulator in the Simulator Canvas
		will disappear. If you delete a Message Object in the Message Canvas,
		any Publish or Subscribe Connections to that message will disappear.</p>

		<p>To delete an object, change the action mode to "Delete" mode, and
		click on the object you wish to delete.</p>
