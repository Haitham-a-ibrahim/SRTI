		<h2>SRTI v2 GUI - Adding Simulator:</h2>
		<p>This section outlines the steps to add a simulator definition to 
		a project in the SRTI v2 GUI.</p> 

		<br> 
		
		<h3>Steps:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>In "Select" mode, click on the "+ New" button at the top of the Object List Panel.</li>
			<img src="images/srtiv2gui_doc_v2gui_addingsimulator_img_01.png" style="max-width:94%;margin:2%;" align="middle">
			<li>Select "Simulator" as the new object you want to add, and click "Next."</li>
			<ul>
				Alternatively, you can select "Import...," which will ask you to select a .simdef file, which is 
				automatically generated when you save other projects in the SRTI v2 GUI. If selecting this option,
				the following steps will become unecessary, although you may want to edit some "file location" properties
				if the simulator was originally on a different machine.
			</ul>
			<img src="images/srtiv2gui_doc_v2gui_addingsimulator_img_02.png" style="max-width:94%;margin:2%;" align="middle">
			<li>Fill in "Simulator Name" (name that the RTI Server will recognize it by),
			"Reference Name" (name of simulator class), "Wrapper File Location" (folder
			location of the RTI Wrapper file, which should also contain the simulator file(s)),
			and "Execute Command" (the terminal command(s) you would use to launch the RTI Wrapper
			from that folder location).</li>
			<img src="images/srtiv2gui_doc_v2gui_addingsimulator_img_03.png" style="max-width:94%;margin:2%;" align="middle">
			<li>Add public variables and functions that exist in the simulator, if required 
			to use in the simulation system. </li>
			<img src="images/srtiv2gui_doc_v2gui_addingsimulator_img_04.png" style="max-width:94%;margin:2%;" align="middle">
			<li>When finished, you'll see the simulator added to the object list in the project.</li>
			<ul>
				If you want a second chance to edit the simulator definition you added, you
				can click on the entry in the Simulator List Panel in "Configure/Edit" mode.
			</ul>
			<img src="images/srtiv2gui_doc_v2gui_addingsimulator_img_05.png" style="max-width:94%;margin:2%;" align="middle">
			<li>Click on the simulator entry in the Simulator List Panel, and it will be 
			added to the Simulator Canvas in the upper-left corner.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>If you want to add a simulator to a specific stage, first select the stage number
				to make it visible on the canvas, and then click on the simulator entry
				in the Simulator List Panel.</li>
				<li>A simulator can only be added once in a stage on the canvas, and it will
				disable itself to prevent you from adding it twice. If you need to add a simulator
				multiple times, it is recommended that you duplicate the simulator files into
				a different folder location, and add them as a new simulator with a different name.</li>
			</ul>
			<img src="images/srtiv2gui_doc_v2gui_addingsimulator_img_06.png" style="max-width:94%;margin:2%;" align="middle">
			<li>Click on the simulator on the Canvas to place it anywhere. It will automatically
			snap along the grid. Horizontal placement
			is for personal organization, but vertical placement defines order of execution,
			where simulators at the top will run before simulators below.</li>
