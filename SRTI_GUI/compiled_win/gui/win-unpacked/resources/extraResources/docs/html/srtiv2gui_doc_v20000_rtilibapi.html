		<h2>SRTI v2.00.00 - RTI Lib API:</h2>
		<p>This section provides extra details on the functionality of the RTI Lib API.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>Brief Overview:</h3>
		<p>The <b>RTI Lib API</b> (Application Programming Interface) is a class that contains a 
		series of public functions to help create and manage a connection with the RTI Server,
		and to publish / subscribe data with the RTI Server. Functionality like creating a 
		connection, disconnecting, publishing a message, subscribing to a message, or waiting
		for the next available message by name, can each be accomplished with a single 
		function call.</p>
		<p>The exact functionality behind these functions is hidden from the user. This level
		of abstraction was a conscious design decision. In future
		or alternate versions of the SRTI, the low-level backend code can be modified (both
		the RTI Server and RTI Lib API are dependent on each other, and would have to be modified
		concurrently), while still maintaining the same function names and parameters. Modfication
		of backend functionality may be desired for improved performance, at expense of certain
		features (using a strict message format rather than flexible JSON, or not supporting
		networked simulation systems across distributed computers, for example).</p>
		<p>The RTI Server does not need to be rewritten to support other languages, but in
		some cases, the RTI Lib API might. It was programmed to consist of simplified functions
		that can be duplicated in other languages, provided they support "sockets" and "JSON parsing."</p>

		<br>

		<h3>How To Use:</h3>
		<p>The RTI Lib API (Java version) is included in the .jar file that contains the RTI Server.
		Regarding SRTI v2.00.00, it is not required for the user to directly utilize the RTI Lib API;
		The RTI Wrapper manages and calls each function when required. 
		The user would only need to concern themselves with the functionality of the RTI Lib API if
		they want to understand the underlying structure of the SRTI system, or if they are preparing
		to write their own RTI Wrapper for their computer language of choice (which in some cases,
		may also require rewriting the RTI Lib API from scratch).</p>
		<p>If using SRTI v1.00.00, the user would need to use the RTI Lib API directly, and would
		need to study its available functions more closely.</p>
