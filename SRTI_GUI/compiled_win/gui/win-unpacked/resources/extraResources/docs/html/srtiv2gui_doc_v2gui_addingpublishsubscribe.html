		<h2>SRTI v2 GUI - Adding Publish / Subscribe:</h2>
		<p>This section outlines the steps to add a publish / subscribe
		connection between a simulator and a message in the SRTI v2 GUI.</p> 

		<br> 
		
		<h3>Steps:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>After having placed a simulator and message on the canvas, change to "connection" mode.</li>

			<li><b>To add a "publish" connection:</b> First, click on a simulator. Then click on the message you 
			want it to publish to. A window will appear asking you to set configuration variables
			that define this connection.</li>
			<ul>To undo a selection, you can click anywhere on the canvas that isn't a simulator or message.</ul>

			<img src="images/srtiv2gui_doc_v2gui_addingpublishsubscribe_img_03.png" style="max-width:94%;margin:2%;" align="middle">
			<li>The "Publish Details" window is similar to the "Subscribe Details" window.
			You will see a list of variables that exist in the message, and will have the 
			option to choose a variable of the same datatype from the simulator to correspond
			to that variable (this means the value in the simulator will be copied to the 
			message at the time the message is published). There are additional variables
			that determine when and how often this message should be published by this 
			simulator; see the HTML Documentation for <b>"SRTI v2.00.00 - RTI Configuration File"</b>
			for a better understanding of these properties.</li>
			<li>After clicking "Confirm," the window will close, and you will see a red box
			with an arrow leading from the simulator to the message.</li>
			<ul>If you want a second chance to edit this connection, you can click on the red box
			in "Configure/Edit" mode.</ul>

			<li><b>Remember:</b> A simulator can publish and subscribe to multiple messages. 
			A message can be published by multiple simulators, and subscribed to
			by multiple simulators.</li>
