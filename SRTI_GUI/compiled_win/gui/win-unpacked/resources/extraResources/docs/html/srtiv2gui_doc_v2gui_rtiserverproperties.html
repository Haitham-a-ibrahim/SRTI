		<h2>SRTI v2 GUI - RTI Server Properties:</h2>
		<p>This section covers details regarding the RTI Server related
		to the SRTI v2 GUI.</p> 

		<br> 
		
		<h3>Brief Overview:</h3>
		<p>The SRTI v2 GUI comes with a copy of the RTI Server (.jar) file, either 
		in the single packed version of the executable, or in 
		<i>"*\resources\extraResources\srti_server\"</i> in the root directory
		of the unpacked version of the executable. The source code of the 
		SRTI v2 GUI checks this location for that .jar file by name.</p>
		<p>If you wish to use a different version of the RTI Server, or 
		a duplicate version in a different location, then you can change 
		which version to reference within the GUI itself. In some cases,
		trying to run the simulation system might trigger an error, 
		because of a bad reference to the RTI Server, in which case you 
		can reset the correct reference.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>How To Acces These Properties:</h3>

		<p>On the Action Mode Bar, select "configure/edit" mode. In this mode,
		when you select any object, properties and buttons will appear in the
		Inpsector Panel. Select the RTI Server in the Message Canvas to see 
		a button to "Change Launch Parameters."</p>

		<p>"Change Launch Parameters" will allow you to change 
		the RTI Server file to use (the .jar file within the v2 GUI 
		folder directory is used by default), as well as whether 
		you are running on "localhost" (more reliable to use this string 
		directly if all simulators are running on the local machine), or 
		"network" (will use your computer's public IP address), and 
		what preferred port number the RTI Server should launch on.</p>
		<p>Both the RTI Server and all simulators will use the properties 
		set here to connect with each other.</p>
