This is the location of the source code for the SRTI Wrapper
(Java version)

The wrapper is meant to act as a method to connect to an open RTI Server without the simulation doing so manually
(the SRTI Wrapper would handle API calls to RTILib instead of the simulation).
One instance of the wrapper would exist for each simulation.

Consists of two separate parts:
- SRTI Server (plus Manager)
	- Similar to v1.00, but with extra logic to enforce 
		automatic time-syncronization based on connected simulators.
	- Double-click to open before launching anything else.


- SRTI Wrapper
	- Language-specific Wrappers to access simulators
		(based on user-defined configuration files)
		and the SRTI Server.
	- Launch with a command similar to the following (in command prompt for Java version):
		>> java -cp "sim.jar;SRTI_Wrapper_v2_14_02.jar" main.Wrapper
	- Currently written in Java, Matlab, and NetLogo, to support simulators in those languages.
			- SRTI_v2_12_02.jar			- Java
			- SRTI_NetLogoWrapper_v2_14_02.jar	- NetLogo (using Java)
			- SRTI_Wrapper.m			- Matlab
		Must be used with SRTI Server v2, not v1.
