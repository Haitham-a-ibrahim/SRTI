SRTI v2.00.00 Examples (Java):
------------------------------

1) First, run this in a command prompt:

	java -jar SRTI_v2_03_01.jar

2) Next, open separate command prompts (4 additional) to folders A,B,C,D and run the following command:

	java -cp "wrapper_example_20190215_1.jar;SRTI_Wrapper_v2_03_01.jar" main.Wrapper

3) On the GUI the appears for the RTI Server, click the button to "Send Start Request To All." 
	This will tell the Wrapper for each simulator to begin.
	The built-in Manager in RTI Server (SRTI v2.00.00 and above) will manage time synchronization based on variables in each Wrapper.
	Each simulator and their Wrapper are typically indpendent of each other: 
		the Manager is not designed to consider multiple simulators for things like "stage transitions" or "ending transitions."




SRTI v2.00.00 Examples (Matlab):
-------------------------------

Identical to Java versions.
Copy "configuration files" as needed.
Matlab script is not pre-compiled: must have a Matlab license to run.
Can run all 4 simulators in Matlab, all 4 in Java, or mix-and-match between languages.
