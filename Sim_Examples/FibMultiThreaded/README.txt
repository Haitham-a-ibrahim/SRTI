To compile and run: 

javac SequentialServer.java
java SequentialServer

This simulates a two-process simulatio. See the comment at the top of the file.

Work in progress:

I am working on a new version in Event.java and ParallelServer.java. This version
does not yet compile or work. It is located in InProgress folder. I think it has
simpler interfaces for simulation developers and is worth discussion.
