Refer to individual simulators for the instruction of each function.
WindSpeedModel.m -> Wind_Speed_Generator
WindPresModel.m -> Wind_Pressure_Simulator
WindLoadModel.m -> Wind_Load_Simulator
StruAnaModel.m -> Structural_Analysis_Simulator
DamageModel.m -> Wind_Damage_Simulator

The default setting is a 20-story building with height = 3.96 m for each floor, width = 30.49m, length = 42.68m.


- Language or Software
