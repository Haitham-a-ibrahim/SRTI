---------------------------
- Name of Simulator
Structural_Analysis_Simulator

- Language or Software
MATLAB R2017b

- Purpose
To obtain the elastic displacement response of each floor by modal analysis using CDM method, given the wind loads, stiffness and damping ratio.

- Instructions
Run the script "StruAnaModel.m" in MATLAB programming environment.
Refer to the script for the definitions of Input and Output Variables.

The default setting is a 20-story building and the stiffness matrix is stored in "Flex_same_h.mat". The displacement and load history are saved in "Disp_Load.mat"
