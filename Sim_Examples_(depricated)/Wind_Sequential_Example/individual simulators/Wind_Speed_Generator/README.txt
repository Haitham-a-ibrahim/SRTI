- Name of Simulator
Wind_Speed_Model

- Language or Software
MATLAB R2017b

- Purpose
To obtain the wind speed at the interest heights at specific time step.

- Instructions
Run the script "WindSpeedModel.m" in MATLAB programming environment.
Refer to the script for the definitions of Input and Output Variables.
The default setting is a 20-story building with height = 3.96 m for each 
story and V10 = 40 m/s. Return the wind speed(m/s) at the mid of each story and the simulation time(sec.).


Declaration:
This simulator was adopted from the original code by Prof. Spence's group.
