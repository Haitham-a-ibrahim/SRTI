This is the location of the source code for the SRTI Wrapper
(C++ version)

The wrapper is meant to act as a method to connect to an open RTI Server without the simulation doing so manually
(the SRTI Wrapper would handle API calls to RTILib instead of the simulation).
One instance of the wrapper would exist for each simulation.
