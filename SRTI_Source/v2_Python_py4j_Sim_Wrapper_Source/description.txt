This is a prototype for a Python Wrapper in SRTI v2.00.00.

The RTI Wrapper normally has to access both the user's simulator and a copy of the RTI Lib API.
The RTI Lib API for SRTI v2.00.00 is available for Java, which Python is not natively compatible with.

Using open-source framework 'py4j', we are able to write a Python RTI Wrapper 
that can connect to a Java version of the RTI Lib API.
Both must import 'py4j' for this to work.
Because this requires an extra step for the user (to install 'py4j' in their Python library),
we still intended to create a native Python RTI Lib API.

To use the 'py4j' version,
first launch the Java-py4j RTI Lib API,
then launch the Python-py4j Wrapper to listen to it and a user's local Python simulator.
